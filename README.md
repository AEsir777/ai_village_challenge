- reducing the epoches will decrease the accuracy
- not normalizing the activation for the first layer input will also decrease the accuracy

compare two tables where one table represents a model with only three layers and controlled the number of neurons in the second layer and the other table represens a model with 4 layers and controlled the number of neurons in the forth layer
- the model with more layers is slightly more accurate than the model with less layers
- as number of neurons increases, the accuracy tends to be higher; however, when the number of neurons is larger enough, there do not seem be that much difference and obvious trend for accuracy.

# ctf
contains kaggle for ai_village_challenge uses numpy, pandas, scikit-learn for classification, clustering, dimention reduction.  
  
# game_attributes_compare
uses matplotlib to convert the data into graphs

# image-recognition
uses Keras and Tensor flow to build the model and analyze images and data
